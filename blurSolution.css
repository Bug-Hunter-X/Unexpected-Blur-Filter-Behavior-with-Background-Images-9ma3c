To resolve this issue, ensure that the element you're applying the blur filter to has its content (text, other elements etc) positioned correctly.  One approach is to wrap all of the content within a separate container element. Then, apply the `filter: blur()` to the container rather than the element with the background image.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Incorrect - Blurs only background-image */
.container {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  filter: blur(5px);
  padding: 20px;
}
.container p {
  color: white;
}

/* Correct - Blurs background image and text */
.container {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  padding: 20px;
}
.container-inner {
  filter: blur(5px);
  color: white;
}

```
By wrapping the content in a `.container-inner` and applying the blur to that, the intended effect is achieved.
