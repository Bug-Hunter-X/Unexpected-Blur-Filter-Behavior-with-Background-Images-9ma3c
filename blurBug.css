The CSS property `filter: blur()` is applied to an element with a `background-image` property causing the image to blur, but other content within the element, such as text or other elements, remains unaffected. This leads to a visually unexpected result where only the background image is blurred, leaving the foreground elements sharp.  This is different from the intended effect of a general blur filter on an element, which would typically blur all content within the element.
